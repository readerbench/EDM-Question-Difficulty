' ' every cow likes salt herring , ' rejoined his wife . ' even prince is fond of fish . ' ' that may be , ' said her husband . ' methinks she would soon be a dear cow if we had to feed her on salt herring . all very well for prince , who fights with the gulls over the last morsel . put the cow out of your head , mother , we are very well off as we are . ' maie sighed . she knew well that her husband was right , but she could not give up the idea of a cow . the buttermilk no longer tasted as good as usual in the coffee ; she thought of sweet cream and fresh butter , and of how there was nothing in the world to be compared with them . one day as matte and his wife were cleaning herring on the shore they heard prince barking , and soon there appeared a gaily painted boat with three young men in it , steering towards the rock . they were students , on a boating excursion , and wanted to get something to eat . ' bring us a junket , good mother , ' cried they to maie . ' ah ! if only i had such a thing ! ' sighed maie . ' a can of fresh milk , then , ' said the students ; ' but it must not be skim . ' ' yes , if only i had it ! ' sighed the old woman , still more deeply . ' what ! have n't you got a cow ? ' but the herring were now ready , and the students ate enough for six , and gave prince some cold meat which they happened to have in the boat . prince sat on his hind legs with delight and mewed like a pussy cat . when all was finished , the students handed matte a shining silver coin , and allowed him to fill his pipe with a special kind of tobacco . they then thanked him for his kind hospitality and went on their journey , much regretted by prince , who sat with a woeful expression and whined on the shore as long as he could see a flip of the boat 's white sail in the distance . maie had never uttered a word , but thought the more . she had good ears , and had laid to heart the story about ahti . ' how delightful , ' thought she to herself , ' to possess a fairy cow ! how delicious every morning and evening to draw milk from it , and yet have no trouble about the feeding , and to keep a shelf near the window for dishes of milk and junkets ! but this will never be my luck .

' did i not tell thee that there is no luck in sunday fishing ?

' it is all very fine to possess a cow , ' said matte , as he cleaned the fish ; ' but what are we going to feed her on ? ' ' we shall find some means , ' said his wife ; and the cow found the means herself . she went out and cropped the seaweed which grew in great abundance near the shore , and always kept in good condition . every one prince alone excepted , thought she was a clever beast ; but prince barked at her , for he had now got a rival . from that day the red rock overflowed with milk and junkets , and every net was filled with fish . matte and maie grew fat on this fine living , and daily became richer . she churned quantities of butter , and he hired two men to help him in his fishing . the sea lay before him like a big fish tank , out of which he hauled as many as he required ; and the cow continued to fend for herself . in autumn , when matte and maie went ashore , the cow went to sea , and in spring , when they returned to the rock , there she stood awaiting them .

' by long experience the man knew there was no good saying any more , and with a sigh he told the poor girl she must return to the forest for the axe . ' that is a good girl , ' said one ; ' i really was too weak to stretch out a wing before she came . i should like to do something to show how grateful i am . ' ' well , let us give her a wreath of flowers that will never fade as long as she wears it , ' cried another . ' and let the tiniest singing birds in the world sit amongst the flowers , ' rejoined the third . ' yes , that will do beautifully , ' said the first . and when the girl stepped into her cottage a wreath of rosebuds was on her head , and a crowd of little birds were singing unseen . the father , who was sitting by the fire , thought that , in spite of her muddy clothes , he had never seen his daughter looking so lovely ; but the stepmother and the other girl grew wild with envy . ' what in the world is the matter ? ' asked the birds sleepily . ' that is our secret , ' said the doves . meanwhile the girl had reached home crosser than ever ; but as soon as her mother heard her lift the latch of the door she ran out to hear her adventures . ' well , did you get the wreath ? ' cried she . ' dirty creatures ! ' answered her daughter . ' do n't speak to me like that ! what do you mean ? ' asked the mother again . ' dirty creatures ! ' repeated the daughter , and nothing else could she say . then the woman saw that something evil had befallen her , and turned in her rage to her stepdaughter . ' you are at the bottom of this , i know , ' she cried ; and as the father was out of the way she took a stick and beat the girl till she screamed with pain and went to bed sobbing . if the poor girl 's life had been miserable before , it was ten times worse now , for the moment her father 's back was turned the others teased and tormented her from morning till night ; and their fury was increased by the sight of her wreath , which the doves had placed again on her head . the day after her marriage the bride sent a messenger , bearing handsome presents to her father , and telling him of the good fortune which had befallen her . as may be imagined , the stepmother and her daughter were so filled with envy that they grew quite ill , and had to take to their beds , and nobody would have been sorry it they had never got up again ; but that did not happen . at length , however , they began to feel better , for the mother invented a plan by which she could be revenged on the girl who had never done her any harm . everything fell out exactly as the woman had hoped . by the aid of her magic mirror the witch beheld the new princess walking in her gardens in a dress of green silk , and in a few minutes had produced a mask so like her , that very few people could have told the difference . however , she counselled the woman that when her daughter first wore it - for that , of course , was what she intended her to do - she had better pretend that she had a toothache , and cover her head with a lace veil . the woman thanked her and paid her well , and returned to her hut , carrying the mask under her cloak . in a few days she heard that a great hunt was planned , and the prince would leave the palace very early in the morning , so that his wife would be alone all day . this was a chance not to be missed , and taking her daughter with her she went up to the palace , where she had never been before . the princess was too happy in her new home to remember all that she had suffered in the old one , and she welcomed them both gladly , and gave them quantities of beautiful things to take back with them . at last she took them down to the shore to see a pleasure boat which her husband had had made for her ; and here , the woman seizing her opportunity , stole softly behind the girl and pushed her off the rock on which she was standing , into the deep water , where she instantly sank to the bottom . then she fastened the mask on her daughter , flung over her shoulders a velvet cloak , which the princess had let fall , and finally arranged a lace veil over her head .
